\chapter*{Abstract}

Many interesting patterns can be uncovered from network data by studying the neighbourhood of nodes. For example, in protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks it has been shown that the function of a protein is strongly related to its interactions with other proteins \cite{schwikowski2000network}. Studying the neighbourhood of nodes can tell us important information not only about the nodes themselves, but also about the network as a whole. However, not much research has been done into studying these neighbourhoods of nodes. The clustering coefficient, one of the few signatures that quantify the topological structure in the neighbourhood of a node, is unable to capture complex patterns that arise in these subnetworks.

Our project defines a novel signature called the \emph{Graphlet Cluster Vector} (GCV) that generalises the clustering coefficient of a node and quantifies the topological structure in the neighbourhood of a node. We apply the GCV signature to economic, protein interaction and metabolic networks and demonstrate its strength by uncovering interesting insights from the data and providing real-world interpretations of our results. 

In the economic networks, we show that the structure of the economic network causes fluctuations in the change of crude oil price. Moreover, we also show that for a given country, a relatively sparse network of trading partners is beneficial for its economy. In the PPI networks, we show that the neighbourhood structure of a protein is influenced by the protein's involvement in RNA processing, translation, metabolism or Golgi endosome sorting. In Metabolic networks, we show that the network of interacting partners of an enzyme is affected by its involvement in several cellular processes, organismal systems or diseases. Moreover, we also quantitatively evaluate the novel GCV signature on clustering random networks and test its performance when dealing with noisy and incomplete data.
