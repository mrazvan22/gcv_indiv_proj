M1: 
implement the code and find the average extended GDV for each node in a network, along with the average GDV of the network


M2:
try to compare multiple network types according to the new E-GDV. Compare with model networks as well


M3:
perform alignment of different networks using the E-GDV and analyse the results. Observe how efficient this new metric is.

Compare the results with classical GDV

M4:
finish writing the report. Include: abstract, background, implementation, experiments, results, further research, conclusion
